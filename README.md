# Numerical Methods

All code currently in C++. Should run in C too with some minor print statement changes.

These were mostly done as part of my college course.
 

## Included Numerical Methods (C++)

Currently includes the following:

- Bisection Method
- Gaussian Elimination
- Gaussian Elimination with Partial Pivoting
- Gaussian Elimination with Scaled Partial Pivoting
- LU Decomposition
- Jacobi method
- Gauss-Seidal method
