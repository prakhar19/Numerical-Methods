# Numerical Methods

All code currently in C++. Should run in C too with some minor print statement changes.

These were mostly done as part of my college course.
 

## Included Numerical Methods (C++)

Currently includes the following:

- Bisection Method
- Newton Raphson
- Gaussian Elimination
- Gaussian Elimination with Partial Pivoting
- Gaussian Elimination with Scaled Partial Pivoting
- LU Decomposition
- Jacobi method
- Gauss-Seidal method
- Successive Over-relaxation method
- Lagrange Polynomial Interpolation
- Newton Polynomial Interpolation
- Composite simpson's one-third rule Integration
- Composite Trapezoidal Integration
- Gaussian Legendre Quadrature (1 dimensional)
