# Numerical Methods

All code currently in C++. Should run in C too with some minor print statement changes.

These were done as a part of my college course.
 

## Included Numerical Methods (C++)

Currently includes the following:

- **Bisection Method**
- **Newton Raphson**
- **Gaussian Elimination**
- **Gaussian Elimination with Partial Pivoting**
- **Gaussian Elimination with Scaled Partial Pivoting**
- **LU Decomposition**
- **Jacobi method**
- **Gauss-Seidal method**
- **Successive Over-relaxation method**
- **Lagrange Polynomial Interpolation**
- **Newton Polynomial Interpolation**
- **Composite simpson's one-third rule Integration**
- **Composite Trapezoidal Integration**
- **Gaussian Legendre Quadrature**
- **Gaussian Legendre Quadrature (2D)** - To solve definite double integrals of type ∫∫ f(x, y) dxdy
- **Euler's Method**
