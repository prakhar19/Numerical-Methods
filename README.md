# Numerical-Methods

All code currently in C++. Should run in C too with some small print statement changes, though not tested.

## Included methods

Currently includes the following:

- Bisection Method
- Gaussian Elimination
- Gaussian Elimination with Partial Pivoting
- Gaussian Elimination with Scaled Partial Pivoting
- LU Decomposition
- Gauss-Jacobi method
- Gauss-Seidal method
